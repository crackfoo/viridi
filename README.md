VIRIDI Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

VIRIDI was founded and developed during the fall of 2017 and spring of 2018. VIRIDI is a highly
focused currency, built on POS, for the Marijuana Industry.

VIRIDI was in the beginning the only cryptocurrency allowing investments in marijuana plants. The
marijuana industry is lucrative business with a billion-dollar value worldwide. The industry is
constantly growing as new countries legalizes the use of marijuana. The foremost use of VIRIDI is
to get access in the investment opportunity, which enables investors to get a high return. The
company have large-scale marijuana plantations in Switzerland and the profit of those are the
underlying value of VIRIDI. This value and product are what enables the company to give the
investors their return on investments. Simply stated, to be able to get access to the investment
opportunity and thereby invest in plants, it is required to own VIRIDI. The demand after VIRIDI is
the main driver of the coin value. The vision is to facilitate the growing and distribution of
marijuana worldwide through investments with an attractive return policy, which will create a
stable and high value of the VIRIDI coin.

In the 4th quarter of 2017, VIRIDI made steps towards expanding brand awareness and utility of the
cryptocurrency. In the 1st quarter of 2018, the plans of 2017 came to fruition. With a variety of
payment solutions designed for mainstream adoption and increased usability, VIRIDI has a very
promising and ambitious future ahead

### Masternode

Triple Security Node

Relying only on the most advanced aspects of the world leading cryptocurrencies, we propose to
use Masternodes to ensure network stability.
To make it possible for everyone to setup a Masternode, we have developed three types of them.
Each type takes a different amount of VIRIDI and brings a variety of income. This system is
called Triple Security Node.

1. Light Node requires 5.000 VIC.
2. Medium Node requires 15.000 VIC.
3. Full Node requires 25.000 VIC.

During POS Masternodes will receive the following reward (different for each type) for maintaining
network stability and performing additional functions:
